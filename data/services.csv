As a Promise Zone, Sacramento receives significant benefits including priority access to federal investments that further local strategic plans, federal staff on the ground to help implement goals, and five full time AmeriCorps VISTA members to recruit and manage volunteers and strengthen the capacity of the Promise Zone partners.

In partnership with more than 60 key partners, the Sacramento Promise Zone will work to coordinate resources, build capacity and create public-private partnerships to drive area revitalization. The partners have adopted the following five goals to improve the quality of life and accelerate revitalization:
​
• Create Jobs
• Increase Economic Activity 
• Improve Educational Opportunities
• Improve Health and Wellness
