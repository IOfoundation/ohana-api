The latest project of the SBCDC is the expansion and programmatic development of the Innovation Hub, which will result in a modern co-working space and start-up incubator where early-stage businesses, micro-entrepreneurs, and application and product developers seeking innovative idea exchange, a collaborative culture, a shared value for social responsibility, and access to education can create job opportunities. Monthly education workshops on such topics as financial literacy, marketing, pitch deck creation, employment tax credit opportunities, and government contracting, will be offered with technical assistance of the Sacramento State Center for Entrepreneurship, prominent Stockton Boulevard district business leaders, and the Office of Councilmember Erica Guerra. Business pitch and maker competitions attracting entrepreneurs and application/product developers will attract prospective SBI Hub tenants and investors to the district and put our commercial corridor on the map of Sacramento’s burgeoning start-up ecosystem.",Frank Louie,Executive Director,(916) 454-2469,staff@stocktonblvdpartnership.org,,"Networking, Physical Space",,,,,,,,Small Business/General,,,,"Coworking Space, Incubator Space, Office Space",,,"Agriculture, Arts, Biosciences Services and Manufacturing, Construction, Education, Energy & Utilities, Finance & Insurance, Health & Childcare, High Tech Services & Manufacturing, Information Technology, Management, Manufacturing, Not for Profit, Other Services, Professional Services, Real Estate, Restaurant & Hotel, Retail, Tourism, Transportation & Warehousing, Wholesale","Idea/Inception, Proof of Concept/Prototype/Market Intro, Rollout, Growth/Expansion/Mature Business",Main Street or Small Business,NOT TARGETED,PBID Boundaries (Along Stockton Blvd between 2nd Ave and 65th Street),Main Physical Location,Fee Charged,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No
