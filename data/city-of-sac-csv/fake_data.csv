SacRT understands that a robust transportation network is critical for our region’s economic future and for the vitality of our many communities. Public transit provides economic opportunities, and drives community growth and revitalization. Transit investment itself creates jobs. Every $1 billion invested in public transit creates 50,000 jobs; and every $1 invested in public transit generates about $4 in economic returns; and every $10 million in capital investment in public transit yields $32 million in increased business sales.
